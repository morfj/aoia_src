                         ANARCHY ONLINE ITEM ASSISTANT
                             http://ia.frellu.net

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
=============
Unzip and run from your location of choice. To avoid possible issues, extract 
to C:\aoia or similar. Running from the Desktop or from inside Program Files, 
may cause problems (in the sense that AOIA wont work) on some systems.

Upgrading:
==========
When upgrading from a previous version I recommend making a copy of your old 
ItemAssistant.db file just to be on the safe side.
If the automated migration to the new version creates wierd results please
send a detailed description of the problem and attach both the old and the 
newly converted ItemAssistant.db file.

Usage:
======
Online help system is available at http://ia-help.frellu.net

Known Issues:
=============
    * If you have copied your AO installation to a new directory and is now
      playing from the new location, Item Assistant will not be able to detect
      that the old installation is not valid any more.
      To fix this you need to open the file called ItemAssistant.conf and either
      - Change the AOPath setting to the new location of your AO installation,
        or,
      - Delete the AOPath setting. Item Assistant will then ask you to specify
        the location on the next startup.
    * Your toons may show up under incorrect dimension nodes.
    * AOIA needs to run with the same, or higher, level of privileges on your 
      computer as the AO client itself is running with. If you run the AO client
      as administrator, you have to do the same with AOIA.
    * Sorting items on the "Backpack" column generates weird results.
    * Moving a backpack or item while AOIA is _not_ running, can result in 
      duplicate items in the AOIA database. Re-open all affected backpacks to 
      rescan the content and fix the sync issue.

      messages from the server have been intercepted.

      backpacks as they are being changed by the user. This should reduce the 
      number of full reparsings you would need to do.

    * Fixed crash bug with zoning and login after 17.8.1.
    * Inventory tree-view now has a node for the "Social" tab.
    * Added context menu to items. You are now able to show itemstats using 
      either auno.org or aomainframe.net. You can also copy the item as a 
      HTML link or VBB link.
    * Updated item database to version 17.8.1.

Version 0.8.2                                       Release Date: 16/01/2007
    * Automatic detection of toon names. Removed possibility to rename a toon 
      name manualy. Names are detected on zone.

      application to the system tray instead. To actually exit the application,
      select "Exit" from the tray menu or the file menu.

Version 0.8.1                                       Release Date: 24/11/2006
    * Fixed a bug in the Inventory view that caused the last character of all 
      itemnames to disappear.

Version 0.8.0                                       Release Date: 7/11/2006
    * Updated the item DB to match v16.4.1 of Anarchy Online.
    * Upgraded to use latest version of SQLite (v3.3.8). You should still be 
      able to use your old DB file.
    * Converted to using UNICODE wherever I can. This means support for the 
      UTF-8 encoded XML files that AO is using, is in place. I have only 
      tested with a Norwegian characterset, but I suspect Russian and 
      whatnot should work as well. The downside is that the app will probably 
      NOT work on Windows 95/98... but who cares?
    * The about box now actually contains some information. :P
    * Removed the "Bot Export" view. It didn't do squat anyway.
    * The "Message View" is now only available in the debug version like 
      originally intended.
    * Now supports a new command line argument called "-db". It specifies 
      what database file to use.
      Example: ItemAssistant.exe -db C:\my_rk2_items.db
    * Re-thought the whole pattern-matcher concept with some new ideas and 
      valuable input by "Senlee".
      (You want YOUR ideas heard? Use the feedback form!)
    * Redesigned the Pattern Matcher GUI. Now have a listview containing the 
      name and availability of all the pocket bosses.
    * Selecting a pocket boss in the list will bring up a report outlining 
      where you have pattern pieces for this pockect boss stored. (Both toon 
      names and backpack names and locations.)
    * The application is now multithreaded. A seperate thread is spawned to 
      calculate the availability column.

Version 0.6.2                                       Release Date: 27/04/2006
    * Pattern Matcher and Inventory list-view now shows proper container names
      for location of pattern pieces.

Version 0.6.1                                       Release Date: 16/04/2006
    * Pattern Matcher has had some work done on it. It no longer does a query 
      on startup, so starup speed has improved. Also the pattern and toon 
      combo-boxes work.
    * Zoning now removes items in the "unknown" container of the current 
      charater.

Version 0.6                                         Release Date: 10/12/2005
    * Backpack parsing to match new packet format in AO 16.1.

    * Release build.
    * AO Item database updated to version 16.0.2
    * Info panel (CTRL-I) that shows details about selected item in the 
      Inventory view.
    * Zoning now auto-deletes items in the "unknown" tree node.
    * Deleting the items in the "unknown" tree node should no longer delete 
      all items.

    * Initial test builds.
